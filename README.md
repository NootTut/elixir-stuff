# Elixir Stuff

This is a very small test bot using [Nostrum](https://github.com/Kraigie/nostrum) mainly to learn Elixir myself
and also to help my awesome friend Tut with Hacktoberfest. It's both a learning ride and a project to apply
that learning in the form of PR's to complete Hacktoberfest.

Don't expect anything serious from this. This was only made to learn Elixir, which I obviously don't know much of
currently. Shitcode should be expected not only now but also in the future when I am proficient with Elixir
as this was only made to learn in the first place.
